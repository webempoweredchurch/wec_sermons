General Stuff
-------------

* May 01, 2006 - Create a way for sermons to have custom resources attached to them, and a way to display these per each custom type

I.e.
Sermon - | Study Guides | Audio | Video | Sermon Notes | Prayer Guide | Small Group Cirriculum (Word Doc) | Builitin | 

* May 01, 2006 - Review how the comment plugin line 670, ve_guestbook, references tt_news articles and filters it's output based on what news article is on the page. We need this in order to tie our other extensions together at the TypoScript Level.
Completed.

* May 02, 2006 - 2 major challenges. First figure out to how to allow a 'type' field on a resource that changes the visible fields. - Jeff researching as well. 
Completed.

Second, find a way to allow resources to be their own plugins which draw thier own content, and have a way to aggregate the content into one 'view'
	NOTE: In finding a way for plugins to render their own content, Jeff discussed a 'registry' where plugins would register and explain how to render records. The idea of this registry, coupled with making a 'plugin' resource type, we could allow SMS to learn how to render a record by creating an instance of the plugin and pushing it the records it needs to render.
	
* May 11, 2006 - Search for populating a TCA upon rendering the backend records. We have the issue of modifying TCA on the fly and making those changes show up on the backend upon rendering
Completed.

Resources

* Resource plugins - just render a single view so we can just use the querystring to render a plugin record, include a querystring parameter as a field in resource type
