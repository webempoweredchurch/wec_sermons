General Stuff
-------------

Find a way to allow resources to be their own plugins which draw thier own content, and have a way to aggregate the content into one 'view'
	NOTE: In finding a way for plugins to render their own content, Jeff discussed a 'registry' where plugins would register and explain how to render records. The idea of this registry, coupled with making a 'plugin' resource type, we could allow SMS to learn how to render a record by creating an instance of the plugin and pushing it the records it needs to render.
