<H1>"Jesus According to Mark "</H1>

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">Here's an <B>instant replay</B> 
of what happened in worship:</P>
<UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px">
  <LI>We heard about a group of seminary students who were surprised to discover 
  that when they heard the entire Gospel of Mark recited out loud, the actions 
  and questions of the disciples often seemed comical. Why would Mark portray 
  these pillars of the faith as naive and even foolish at times? 
  <LI>We learned that Mark was the first Gospel written; Matthew and Luke used 
  Mark when they were composing their own Gospel accounts. Mark - thought to be 
  John Mark, Peter's interpreter - wrote down the important information about 
  the life, death and resurrection of Jesus as the disciples and other 
  eye-witnesses were dying out. His Gospel is fast-paced, beginning abruptly and 
  ending abruptly (if you consider 16:8 the ending of the original Gospel). 
  <LI>We noticed how Mark lets the audience in on a "secret" in the very first 
  verse - Jesus is the Son of God. Throughout the book, others proclaim Jesus as 
  the Son of God - God does, demons do, Jesus himself does, and even a Roman 
  centurion realizes it! But the disciples never do figure it out. 
  <LI>We looked at <A 
  href="#">Mark 
  10:35-45</A> where James and John ask Jesus if they can sit by him in heaven. 
  This is after they have spent all kinds of time with Jesus, hearing him teach 
  and seeing him perform miracles. They still think his ministry is all about 
  getting glory, and they want a piece of it for themselves. Jesus once more 
  patiently tries to explain that his kingdom is not about being great so others 
  can serve you. It's about lowering yourself and serving others to be the 
  greatest. The cup Jesus drank is the cup of love to the point of death and 
  beyond. James and John had no idea what they were even asking! 
  <LI>We realized that Mark is telling us that, like the original disciples, we 
  can also spend a lot of time with Jesus and still not understand what he is 
  all about. If our prayers to him are focused on what he can do for us, how he 
  can bless us, how we want to be in a mansion in heaven, then we have missed 
  the point along with James and John. But, like them, when we know Jesus as the 
  crucified Savior and risen Lord, then we can begin to understand the meaning 
  of who Jesus was. 
  <LI>We prayed that God would forgive our foolishness, even as Jesus forgave 
  his disciples when they didn't understand. We asked to meet Jesus as the 
  crucified and risen one so that we could begin to understand. 
  <LI>We celebrated communion at the welcome table. Jesus invites us to come 
  with whatever is on our hearts - joy, emptiness or brokenness - and he meets 
  us there. </LI></UL>
