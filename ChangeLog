	* trunk/wec_sermons/class.tx_wecsermons_xmlView.php (modified)
	- BUGFIX: Changed hook parameters to pass-by-reference, after
	removing pass-by-reference at call time from tx_wecapi_list calls.
	This was causing the hooks to not pass information back such as
	channel_link fields.

	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	**** Commit to trunk
	- Added recursive pid list to xmlView(), allowing recursive searching
	for records.

	- Added type_alttitle fields to getSermonResources() and
	getSeriesResources() functions, so that resources can provide
	alttitle information.

	- Added wec_sermons_resourceUploadPath to TSFE register, allowing the
	customized resource file path to be accessed from TypoScript.

	* branches/slezak-dev/wec_sermons_0_9_11rc2/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/class.tx_wecsermons_resourceTypeTca.php (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/static/setup.txt (modified)
	- BUGFIX: item_link.field was still declared in setup.txt though this
	had been obsolete since changeset [270], causing relative links to be
	rendered rather than absolute links. Added a line to null the field
	property, allowing item_link to render as expected.

	- BUGFIX: Removed parseFunc stdWrap from tx_wecsermons_speakers email
	property, which was stopping the email field from being encoded with
	(at) instead of @.

	- Added recursive pid list to xmlView(), allowing recursive searching
	for records.

	- Added islinked and type_alttitle fields to getSermonResources() and
	getSeriesResources() functions, so that resources obey the linking
	states, and can provide alttitle information.

	- Added wec_sermons_resourceUploadPath to TSFE register, allowing the
	customized resource file path to be accessed from TypoScript.

	- Changed relevant uploads/tx_wecsermons/ string values to
	{register:wec_sermons_resourceUploadPath}/, allowing resources to
	obey the customized path from extension configuration.

	- Changed sql query in resourceType_items() to use best practice
	methods of filtering backend records. Where clause now uses
	t3lib_BEfunc calls.

05/29/07 22:09:47 brian [314]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	- BUGFIX : RESOURCE_CONTENT did not initialize the local_cObj
	properly, causing other resources' data to be used in some
	circumstances.

05/29/07 22:04:52 brian [313]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/doc/manual.sxw (modified)
	- Updated manual.sxw

	* trunk/wec_sermons/flexform_ds_pi1.xml (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/locallang_db.php (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	* Added CURRENT and PREVIOUS displays to the plugin, allowing detail
	views of sermon and series records marked as &#34;current&#34; or the
	&#34;previous&#34; to current.

05/24/07 15:53:20 brian [311]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/class.tx_wecsermons_resourceTypeTca.php (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/ext_conf_template.txt (added)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/ext_tables.php (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/ext_tables.sql (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/locallang_db.php (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/tca.php (modified)
	* Added SMS resource file path as an extension configuration option.
	Now administrators can configure the plug-in to use an alternate
	upload folder for files attached through the 'File' Back End form
	field.

	* Added 'current' field to both the sermon and series tables, and
	modified the hook upon file save so that only one record can have
	this field enabled at any given time. Still need to implement the
	logic for these fields.

	* trunk/wec_sermons/tca.php (modified)
	- Added an &#34;Is Linked&#34; field to all of the SMS records. This provides
	a separate state of every record, indicating whether or not the
	record is linked to in the Front End. If a record's &#34;Is Linked&#34;
	checkbox is cleared, that record will render on the Front End, but
	without a link to the single view, or direct link to the file or url.

	- Updated the CSH for all records, including hidden, start, stop,
	access and islinked fields.
