07/26/07 15:19:40 brian [386]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/ext_emconf.php (modified)
	- Updated version to 0.9.3 for release

07/21/07 21:32:01 brian [385]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	- Bugfix: Corrected a mis-spelling in $startDate variable when
	calculating start date for plugin filter. Also added the check for
	n/n/n or n-n-n date formats.

07/19/07 20:25:05 brian [384]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/doc/manual.sxw (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	- Improvement: Added a check for proper loading of searchbox subpart
	- New Feature: Added processing to the startDate and endDate
	properties within listView and latestView, which accepts the function
	'date()' to calculate todays date. This allows one to specify a
	moving window of records to be shown, such as 'date()-365'.
	- Bugfix: startDate and endDate now filter series records, if a non-
	grouped list of series records is chosen.
	- Updated documentation
	- Removed trailing spaces

07/19/07 02:26:28 brian [383]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	- Rolled back bugfix for series season and series topic logic checks,
	as this would cause mysql errors.

07/18/07 23:48:03 brian [382]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/doc/manual.sxw (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	- Udated documentation with proper occurrence_date marker name
	- Bugfix: getSeriesResources and getSermonResources functions were
	filtering out single view records by the pid. The starting points
	should be obeyed for views other than single views.
	- Bugfix: Corrected series_season and series_topics subpart marker
	processing, as they were not saving current and previous row before
	changing context to related tables.

07/14/07 20:43:21 brian [379]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/doc/manual.sxw (modified)
	- Updated change log in manual.sxw

07/09/07 15:28:31 brian [364]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/doc/manual.sxw (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	- New Feature: Modified the results browser so that it will render
	only if there is more than one page of results to be shown.

07/09/07 15:09:35 brian [363]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/doc/manual.sxw (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/static/constants.txt (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/static/setup.txt (modified)
	- New Feature: Added the Smart Display option, allowing a user to
	turn off the auto-detection of SINGLE view requests. This is needed
	when you have two plugins enabled on a page, one set to always show a
	list or latest view, and the other showing a single view.

07/03/07 22:14:28 brian [362]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	- BUGFIX: Added a check for ###CONTENT### subpart marker for single,
	latest, and list views. If this is not available then it could throw
	Apache into a loop.

07/03/07 14:28:29 brian [361]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	- BUGFIX: list and latest views were using piVars['recordType'] to
	specify the current table, when this should be done from plugin or
	typoscript. Configured to set and use $this-&gt;internal['currentTable']

	- BUGFIX: Processing the ITEM part of a template when it was not
	present in grouped views caused the plugin to fail. Created branch
	that if ITEM subpart is not present, we do not try to process.

07/02/07 20:35:05 brian [356]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/ext_tables.php (modified)
	- BUGFIX: Resources were not ordering themselves by crdate
	descending, rather by crdate ascending and title descending. Moved
	the DESC keyword to the proper place.

06/29/07 04:45:30 brian [351]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	- BUGFIX: Group Table setting from TypoScript was misnamed and
	looking at wrong scope in the configuration. Set to check
	plugin.tx_wecsermons_pi1.groupTable propery

06/29/07 03:58:00 brian [350]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	- BUGFIX: Layout code was not being set in the proper place for it to
	work through the TypoScript setting. Placed this in each view's
	function so that it is processed.

06/20/07 19:06:13 brian [345]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/doc/manual.sxw (modified)
	- Updated manual.sxw with update on &#34;Template Name&#34; field of SMS
	Resource Types, and how this field defaults to TEMPLATE_+ Marker Name

06/16/07 23:36:43 brian [343]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	- BUGFIX: Corrected an order of operations problem with grouped
	views. We were switching context to sermons before series were done.

	- BUGFIX: Corrected grouped output query. Searching for series uids
	within the sermons record was not returning the proper results. Now
	query uses find_in_set function to find series uids within the
	series.uid field.

06/12/07 16:00:26 brian [339]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/static/constants.txt (modified)
	- Constants document change

	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/static/constants.txt (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/static/setup.txt (modified)
	- Added constant for xmlview maxdetailResults to limit the number of
	items in an xml feed.

06/11/07 18:10:15 brian [337]
	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/static/setup.txt (modified)
	- Added trim to title, description, and author of RSS feed to clean
	up any white space.
	- xmlView now merges resource fields with the sermon fields, so that
	all are available to TypoScript.

06/01/07 21:01:03 brian [332]
