	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/tca.php (modified)
	* Completed implementation of series resources. Series now support
	resources and resource markers within series

	related to a sermon series.

	* Updated internal documentation

	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)

	* Created resources for series records. Series are now able to have
	resources attached directly to them. Need to create the query code
	for retrieving series resources, and complete all code to allow this
	to work.

	* Updated the logic for showing sermons on series single views, as
	links to resource single views were not created properly. Series
	single view sermon resources linked to the series record, not the
	parent sermon record.

	* trunk/wec_sermons/doc/manual.sxw (modified)
	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	* Removed checking for existence of resources on sermon records,
	because we always want to process any resource subpart markers and
	empty them, even if no resource records are attached.

	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)

	with PHP 4

	* trunk/wec_sermons/pi1/class.tx_wecsermons_pi1.php (modified)
	* Refactored marker based template processing and added pre-
	processing of template subparts. This eliminates a great deal of
	overhead by only processing those markers and subparts which are
	defined.

	processing.
